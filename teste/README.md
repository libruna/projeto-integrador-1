# monitor

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Using Rust Inside Flutter

This project leverages Flutter for GUI and Rust for the backend logic,
utilizing the capabilities of the
[Rinf](https://pub.dev/packages/rinf) framework.

To run and build this app, you need to have
[Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install),
[Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install),
and [Protobuf compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation)
installed on your system.
You can check that your system is ready with the commands below.
Note that all the Flutter subcomponents should be installed.

```bash
rustc --version
protoc --version
flutter doctor
```

You also need to have the CLI tool for Rinf ready.

```bash
cargo install rinf
```

Messages sent between Dart and Rust are implemented using Protobuf.
If you have newly cloned the project repository
or made changes to the `.proto` files in the `./messages` directory,
run the following command:

```bash
rinf message
```

Now you can run and build this app just like any other Flutter projects.

```bash
flutter run
```

For detailed instructions on writing Rust and Flutter together,
please refer to Rinf's [documentation](https://rinf-docs.cunarist.com).
